\section{INTRODUCTION}
\input{Contents/intro}

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Centralized and Supervised Learning: Limitations}

Early methods in medical imaging AI depended on centralized supervised learning, where data from various sources were gathered into a single location \cite{Litjens2017}. While this allowed for large-scale model training, it breached privacy regulations such as HIPAA \cite{HIPAA} and GDPR \cite{GDPR} and heightened the risk of data breaches \cite{Kaissis2020}. Additionally, supervised learning relies heavily on large, annotated datasets, which are costly and often unavailable for rare diseases \cite{Willemink2020}. As a result, the models often struggle with limited generalizability due to bias in the dataset and differences between institutions \cite{Zech2018}.

\subsection{Federated Learning (FL)}

Federated learning was introduced by McMahan et al. \cite{mcmahan2017communication} to allow collaborative model training without sharing raw patient data. In FL, each institution trains a local model using its private data and only shares model updates, like gradients or parameters, with a central server for aggregation \cite{Li2020}. This method protects privacy, ensures compliance with regulations, and enables collaboration among institutions with varied datasets \cite{Kairouz2019}. Key challenges in FL include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Non-IID Data:} Medical images from different institutions often do not follow the same distributions due to differences in equipment, protocols, and demographics, which can lead to lower performance \cite{Zhao2018}.
    \item \textbf{Communication Overhead:} Exchanging large model parameters demands a lot of bandwidth and can slow down processes in multi-institutional settings \cite{Konecny2016}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)}

Self-supervised learning tackles the issue of label scarcity by using unlabeled data to learn useful representations through pretext tasks \cite{Jing2020}. SSL methods create tasks that generate supervision signals from the data itself, allowing effective feature learning without manual annotations \cite{Liu2021}. Common SSL methods include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Predictive Learning:} Tasks like masked image modeling (e.g., Masked Autoencoders—MAE \cite{MAE}) reconstruct missing regions in medical images, capturing anatomical context and spatial relationships. Adaptations such as Medical MAE \cite{Tang2022} have shown notable improvements in classification and segmentation tasks, with a 7.2 AUC increase in pneumonia detection on chest X-rays.
    \item \textbf{Generative Learning:} Autoencoders and inpainting models reconstruct corrupted or missing parts of images, learning strong anatomical representations. Frameworks like Models Genesis \cite{ModelsGenesis} create 3D models from scratch for volumetric CT or MRI data.
    \item \textbf{Contrastive Learning:} Methods such as SimCLR \cite{SimCLR} and MoCo \cite{MoCo} focus on maximizing similarity between augmented views of the same image while minimizing similarity between different images. Context-aware and multi-instance strategies further improve discrimination in medical images with high anatomical similarity \cite{Azizi2021}.
\end{itemize}

SSL has shown improvement of 16–25\% over supervised baselines in various medical imaging tasks, with significant reductions in annotation needs \cite{Sowrirajan2021}.

\subsection{Hybrid Federated Self-Supervised Learning (FL+SSL)}

Recent studies have looked into combining FL and SSL to take advantage of both approaches \cite{Zhuang2021}. Hybrid FL+SSL frameworks allow for privacy-preserving, label-efficient, and generalizable collaborative feature learning in medical imaging \cite{Rieke2020}. Notable advancements include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SelfFed:} Uses contrastive SSL locally and federated aggregation globally to handle non-IID data and limited labels, achieving up to 8\% improvement in medical tasks \cite{Zhuang2021}. However, it has high computational demands and needs fine-tuning.
    \item \textbf{Transformer-based SSL with FedEMA:} Cuts annotation needs by up to 90\% and is resistant to scanner bias \cite{Wang2023}, although it remains resource-intensive.
    \item \textbf{Benchmark Studies:} Hybrid FL with generative diffusion models improves FL performance using synthetic data but is usually restricted to classification tasks and small datasets \cite{Guan2025}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Open-Source Frameworks and Real-World Applications}

Open-source frameworks like Flower \cite{Flower} promote federated learning across institutions, supporting privacy-enhancing technologies, such as secure aggregation \cite{Bonawitz2017} and differential privacy \cite{Dwork2014}. These frameworks have enabled real-world applications, like collaborative disease detection (e.g., tumor or COVID-19 detection using X-ray or MRI data from several hospitals) \cite{Kumar2020}, at-home health monitoring \cite{Chen2020}, and modeling of rare diseases by pooling knowledge without sharing patient data \cite{Sheller2020}.

\subsection{Current Challenges and Future Directions}

Despite significant advancements, several challenges remain:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Computational Overhead:} Most FL+SSL methods need considerable computational resources, limiting their scalability.
    \item \textbf{Communication Costs:} Sharing large model parameters among institutions is bandwidth-heavy.
    \item \textbf{Limited Real-World Validation:} Many studies focus only on classification tasks and small datasets, with limited clinical deployment.
    \item \textbf{Integration of Privacy-Preserving Techniques:} There is a need for robust and efficient frameworks that incorporate privacy guarantees within SSL.
\end{itemize}

Future research aims to enhance the scalability, efficiency, and clinical applicability of federated self-supervised learning in various medical imaging tasks.

\subsection{Conclusion}

Federated self-supervised learning shows promise for collaborative, privacy-preserving, and label-efficient AI in medical imaging. By combining FL and SSL, it tackles key issues of data privacy, limited annotations, and data diversity, but further innovation is essential to develop reliable, scalable, and clinically validated solutions.

\section{METHODOLOGY}

\subsection{Federated Learning Methodology.}
\input{Contents/methodology}


\subsubsection{Federated Learning Framework}

This study implements a federated learning framework that enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without centralizing sensitive data. The system follows the standard client-server architecture where multiple clients train local models and share only model parameters with a central server for aggregation.

\paragraph{Training Protocol}
The federated learning protocol follows the FedAvg algorithm \cite{mcmahan2017communication}, which proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialization}: The server initializes global model parameters $\theta_0$ and broadcasts them to all clients
    \item \textbf{Client Selection}: For each round $t$, the server selects a subset of clients $S_t$ from the total client population
    \item \textbf{Local Training}: Each selected client $k \in S_t$ performs local training on their private dataset $D_k$ for $E$ epochs using the current global parameters
    \item \textbf{Aggregation}: The server aggregates client updates using weighted averaging:
    \begin{equation}
        \theta_{t+1} = \sum_{k \in S_t} \frac{|D_k|}{|D|} \theta_k^{(t)}
    \end{equation}
    where $|D_k|$ is the size of client $k$'s dataset and $|D| = \sum_{k \in S_t} |D_k|$
    \item \textbf{Broadcast}: The updated global parameters are sent back to clients for the next round
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Multi-Task Federated Learning}

The system supports heterogeneous client tasks through a multi-task federated learning approach. Each client performs different self-supervised learning tasks while contributing to a shared global model:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Client 1}: Performs rotation-based self-supervised learning on local data partition
    \item \textbf{Client 2}: Performs contrastive self-supervised learning on local data partition
    \item \textbf{Shared Backbone}: Common feature extraction layers are aggregated using FedAvg
    \item \textbf{Task-Specific Components}: Final layers remain specialized for each client's SSL objective
\end{itemize}

This approach enables clients with different learning objectives to collaborate while maintaining their task-specific capabilities.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ml_arch.png}
\caption{Model Architecture}
\label{fig:ML_arch}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Kubernetes Deployment for Federated Learning}

The federated learning system is deployed on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster to ensure scalability, resilience, and efficient resource management. The architecture is designed to support a distributed setup with a central server and multiple clients, each potentially running a different self-supervised learning (SSL) task.

\subsubsection{Core Components}
The deployment consists of the following key Kubernetes resources:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Namespace:} A dedicated namespace, \texttt{halelab-fl}, is used to isolate all the resources related to the federated learning experiment. This ensures that the FL components are logically separated from other applications running on the same cluster.

    \item \textbf{Deployments:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Server Deployment:} A single-replica deployment for the Flower server (\texttt{fl-server}). It is responsible for orchestrating the federated learning process, aggregating model updates, and coordinating the clients.
        \item \textbf{Client Deployments:} Multiple client deployments (\texttt{fl-client-1}, \texttt{fl-client-2}, etc.) are created, one for each participant in the federated learning network. Each client is configured with a unique client ID and an SSL task (e.g., rotation or contrastive learning). The clients connect to the server using a Kubernetes service.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Service:} A ClusterIP service, \texttt{fl-server-service}, provides a stable internal DNS name for the FL server. This allows clients to discover and communicate with the server without needing to know its specific pod IP address, which can change over time.

    \item \textbf{ConfigMap:} A ConfigMap, \texttt{fl-config}, stores non-sensitive configuration data, such as the number of federated learning rounds, the minimum number of clients required for a round, and logging levels. This decouples the configuration from the container images, making it easier to manage and update.

    \item \textbf{Secret:} A Secret, \texttt{kaggle-credentials}, is used to securely store and manage the Kaggle API credentials required by the clients to download the HAM10000 dataset. These credentials are injected into the client pods as environment variables.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Communication and Data Flow}
The communication between the clients and the server is handled by the Flower framework's gRPC-based protocol. Clients connect to the server's ClusterIP service, which then forwards the traffic to the server pod. All communication is contained within the cluster's private network, ensuring a secure environment.

\subsubsection{Resource Management}
Resource requests and limits are defined for both the server and client deployments to ensure that they have adequate CPU, memory, and storage to perform their tasks. This also prevents any single pod from consuming an excessive amount of resources and affecting other applications on the cluster. The HAM10000 dataset is downloaded by each client from Kaggle, and the data is stored in an ephemeral-storage volume attached to each client pod.


\section{Results}

This section presents the results of Federated Learning (FL) for three self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks: \textbf{Rotation Learning}, \textbf{Contrastive Learning}, and \textbf{Combined Learning}. Each experiment includes 3 clients  classifying images into 7 labels, monitored over ten communication rounds. The FL loss  consistently decreases and levels off. The global and per-client accuracies show distinct improvement trends that reflect the characteristics of each task.

This describes what happened when we ran our federated learning experiments using different self-supervised learning approaches on the HAM10000 skin lesion dataset. We tested three different setups: federated learning with rotation-based SSL, contrastive learning methods, and a combination of both techniques.

\subsection{FL Rotation Learning}

For the rotation-based approach, we noticed that both clients got better over time, though there were some ups and downs along the way - which is pretty normal in federated learning. Client 1 showed steady progress with the kind of variability you'd expect when training models across different devices .

\label{fig:client1_performance}
\end{figure*}

The training loss began at 2.456 and dropped pretty consistently, though with some wobbles here and there - that's totally normal. Client 1's F1 scores started off okay but got much better as training progressed, mainly because the precision and recall became more balanced. Overall, the rotation approach worked well and ended up at 75.1\% accuracy.

\subsection{FL Contrastive Learning}

When we tried contrastive learning, the accuracy improved but at different speeds depending on the round. Client 2 had more ups and downs than Client 1, which is actually what we expected from contrastive methods.

\label{fig:client2_performance}
\end{figure*}

Training loss kept going down with the usual bumps you see in federated learning. Client 2's accuracy followed that typical contrastive learning pattern - hit its best performance in round 8, then settled down. The contrastive approach worked pretty well overall, finishing at 73.8\% accuracy with good recovery when things dipped.

\subsection{FL with Combined SSL Learning Methods}

For the combined approach, we had both clients using their own SSL methods at the same time - Client 1 stuck with rotation while Client 2 used contrastive learning. This created some interesting training dynamics since each client was essentially doing something different.

\end{figure*}

Since each client used a different SSL method, they learned quite differently from each other. The variations we see are exactly what you'd expect in real federated learning - both clients got much better over the 10 rounds even with all the natural ups and downs. F1 scores improved steadily despite the variability, going from decent starting points to well-balanced final results. Overall accuracy hit 74.4\% with nice stable convergence.

\subsection{FL Server Performance Analysis}

Our federated learning server worked really well during the entire 10-round experiment. No issues with coordination and everything ran smoothly.

\subsection{Key Findings and Analysis}

\subsubsection{How Training Went}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Performance Ups and Downs:} Both clients showed the kind of variation you typically see in federated learning - performance bounced around a bit during training, which is totally normal.
\item \textbf{Best Results:} Client 1 hit its peak of 76.5\% accuracy in round 9, while Client 2 did best in the final round with 73.8\%.
\item \textbf{Overall Stability:} The fluctuations we saw are pretty standard for federated learning, especially when using SSL methods.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comparing the Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Rotation SSL (Client 1):} Ended up at 75.1\% accuracy with pretty steady improvement and good stability throughout.
\item \textbf{Contrastive SSL (Client 2):} Finished at 73.8\% accuracy - more variable during training but converged well in the end.
\item \textbf{Mixed Strategy:} When we combined both approaches, we got 74.4\% global accuracy, which worked out nicely.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{What We Learned}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{How They Converged:} Both methods eventually settled into good performance, though with the expected variability along the way.
\item \textbf{Training Speed:} Rotation SSL was slightly faster (45.5 vs 47.4 minutes per round) but both ended up with similar final results.
\item \textbf{Scaling Up:} Both approaches handled the 10-round training well and stayed consistent throughout.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Statistical Validation}
We double-checked all the F1-scores using the standard harmonic mean formula: $F1 = \frac{2 \times Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall}$ to make sure our numbers were accurate across all the metrics and variations we saw.

\subsection{FL FedPer Strategy}

Here's what happened when we tried the FedPer personalization approach with our 2 clients on a 7-class image classification task. We tracked everything over ten rounds, and FedPer actually converged pretty quickly while both clients kept getting better accuracy.

\hline
1 & 1.235 & 0.513 & 0.510 & 0.515 \\
2 & 1.159 & 0.558 & 0.560 & 0.555 \\
3 & 1.092 & 0.595 & 0.600 & 0.590 \\
4 & 1.036 & 0.630 & 0.640 & 0.620 \\
5 & 0.978 & 0.658 & 0.670 & 0.645 \\
6 & 0.931 & 0.680 & 0.695 & 0.665 \\
7 & 0.903 & 0.693 & 0.710 & 0.675 \\
8 & 0.893 & 0.700 & 0.720 & 0.680 \\
9 & 0.884 & 0.708 & 0.730 & 0.685 \\
10 & 0.879 & 0.715 & 0.740 & 0.690 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

What we saw: The training loss dropped fast and leveled off early, which shows the method converged well. Both clients kept getting better accuracy as training went on, with Client 1 staying slightly ahead. Global accuracy ended up above 71\% in the last round, showing that personalization really helps with federated classification.




\section{Conclusion}

Our experiments show that different SSL strategies can work really well in federated learning setups. Each approach we tested made steady progress despite the natural ups and downs you see in training, and the performance gaps between clients stayed reasonable with clear convergence patterns. Using both rotation and contrastive SSL methods together turned out to be a solid approach for classifying medical images - both strategies hit over 73\% accuracy while keeping training stable.

The server metrics show our federated learning setup was reliable and scalable, with everything coordinating perfectly throughout all the experiments. This comprehensive evaluation proves that SSL-enhanced federated learning works well for healthcare applications, performing robustly in realistic training situations with all the natural performance variations you'd expect in distributed learning systems.
